Hello there.

For Verilog project files, I found it easier to only share script files rather than the entire project file as the builds take forever
to transfer. As a result, I decided to only every save the .v files, which could easily be imported to a project. This was to save time
as there was no guarantee that a computer would be available in any given laboratory on campus meaning I would not have access to a
previous project I was working on.

All files included are source files, with the exception of Nexus4DDR_Master, which is a constraint file.
